# SA CoParents — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Enhance the SA CoParents platform with comprehensive Joint Professional artefacts
(Joint Report, Joint Agreement, Professional Intro PDF) designed for mediators
and attorneys with strict neutral-language guardrails. Implement deep HIPAA and
Texas HB 300 compliance hardening (PHI access logs, legal pages, breach
runbooks), security audits, secure sharing flows, and encrypted email
transmission via Virtru.

**Product principles:** strict clinical guardrails on safety data, neutral
non-adjudicative language in all reports, explicit user consent before sharing,
and robust privacy policies.

## Core User Personas
- Separated / co-parenting parents preparing for mediation or court
- Mediators, family attorneys, and DV practitioners receiving reports
- Coordinators & admin operators monitoring high-risk cases
- Texas HB 300 covered entities reviewing PHI handling

## Architecture Snapshot
Frontend: React 19 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
Backend: FastAPI + Motor/MongoDB
PDF: `fpdf2` (`pdf_service.py`, `joint_*_pdf.py`, `admin_nd_case_pdf.py`)
Email: Resend SDK (default) + Virtru Gateway SMTP (flag-gated, BAA-pending)
LLM: Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Emergent LLM Key
Auth: Custom JWT (`auth.py`)

## What's Implemented
### 2026-02-21 — Compliance & Joint Artefact hardening
- Full 32-section Privacy Policy + Policy Refresh Banner
- Texas HB 300 endpoints (`hb300_routes.py`), Notice page, breach runbook,
  breach drill executed
- Virtru Hosted Gateway SMTP relay (flag-off pending BAA)
- `PreShareConsentDialog` on all 4 sharing entry points
- "Private by Default" + "No Privilege" banners on all agreement PDFs
- Sample PDF dynamic serving `/api/insights/samples/{filename}` (fixed
  static SPA fallback bug)
- SEC-001: redacted reset/verification tokens from failure logs

### 2026-02-22 — Scoped safe-only code-review refactor
- Extracted shared `bandPillClass` / `bandBarClass` helpers into
  `/app/frontend/src/lib/scoreBandStyles.js`; replaced 4 nested-ternary
  blocks across `SpecialNeedsV2PsychologicalDeepDiveReport.jsx` and
  `SpecialNeedsV2EducationalDeepDiveReport.jsx`.
- Replaced dynamic `__import__("os")` in `safety_assessment_routes.py`
  with a proper module-level `import os`.
- Refactored `_coach_context_block` in `ai_service.py` (was
  cyclomatic 26, depth 6) into three small helpers:
  `_extract_goal_labels`, `_extract_priority_topics`, and a linear
  `_coach_context_block`. Behaviour parity verified with unit checks.
- Deliberately deferred (per user + prior handoff): mass hook-deps,
  circular-import "fixes", MD5 swap, localStorage swap — all documented
  as regressions in previous sessions.

### 2026-02-22 — Public shareable link for the Joint Agreement Draft
- New backend endpoints in `joint_agreement_routes.py`:
  - `POST /api/joint-agreement/{share_id}/share-link` — mints JWT
    (revocable + time-limited, defaults 7 days, 1/7/14/30 choices).
  - `GET /api/joint-agreement/shared/{token}` — public JSON view.
  - `GET /api/joint-agreement/shared/{token}/pdf` — public PDF.
  Consent-gated at mint; every read records a PHI-access log entry
  against the sending parent (`external_read_via_share_link` /
  `external_download_via_share_link`).
- New frontend page `pages/JointAgreementShared.jsx` at
  `/joint-agreement/shared/:token` — no login, provenance banner
  ("Shared by <parent>"), full side-by-side content, PDF button.
- Extracted `Bucket` + `Section` render into
  `components/joint/JointAgreementSections.jsx` so authenticated and
  public views share layout without duplication.
- "Get shareable link" button + dialog added to `JointAgreement.jsx`
  next to "Email to professional". Uses `requestPreShareConsent()`
  gate, offers expire-days selector, copy button, and revoke.
- Coverage: `tests/test_iter123_joint_agreement_share_link.py` — 4
  tests cover mint → view → PDF → revoke, wrong-doc-type rejection,
  and invalid-token rejection. All pass.

### 2026-02-22 — P1 shipments: Email + Link for Joint Report + PDF Parent View
- `POST /api/joint-professional-report/{share_id}/email` now mints a
  30-day preview share token, records it under the sending parent
  with an `Emailed to <recipient>` label, and passes an absolute
  `/api/joint-professional-report/preview/{token}` URL down to
  `send_joint_professional_report`. Response gained
  `preview_included`/`preview_jti` fields; `joint_report_emails` rows
  now carry a `preview_jti` link back to the minted token.
- `email_service.send_joint_professional_report` accepts optional
  `preview_url`; when provided, HTML body renders an "Open the joint
  report online" pill button and plaintext gets the URL block.
  Backward-compatible: absent → block is omitted.
- Joint Agreement PDF (`joint_agreement_pdf.py`) rebuilt to lead
  with the 5-bucket Parent View (matches JointAgreementParentView.jsx
  on-screen). The classic row-strip layout moved to "Appendix A -
  Detailed Item Breakdown". Backward-compatible: payloads without
  `parent_view` render the appendix only.
- Phase 3 Question-Tone Rewrites — Table 1 (SNC v2) shipped:
  s1q6, s1q7, s4q7 rewritten to neutral tone in
  `coparenting_questions.py`. Scoring engine untouched; reverse
  flags preserved so past submissions still map correctly. Deep
  Dive banks (Med/Edu/Psych) still pending per-item enumeration.
- Coverage: `tests/test_iter126_...py` — 5 new tests (30-day expiry
  verified, preview URL passthrough, HTML+text block presence,
  PDF parent-view+appendix presence, empty-payload safety).
  All 60 combined iter113-126 tests pass.

### 2026-02-22 — Share Management Panel + Reviewer Analytics + Phase 3 Deep-Dive
- `record_phi_access(...)` accepts optional `jti`; the four shared
  endpoints (`/joint-agreement/shared/*`, `/joint-professional-report/shared/*`)
  now stamp the token id on every external read + download so per-link
  analytics can be aggregated.
- `record_share_token(...)` persists the signed JWT under `token` on
  the `share_tokens` row (owner-scoped, filtered by `user_id`) so the
  owner's UI can surface copy-link / open-preview actions.
- `GET /api/share/mine` enriched: each row carries `view_count`,
  `download_count`, `last_opened_at`, `token`, `note` alongside the
  existing status split (active/expired/revoked).
- New frontend component
  `/app/frontend/src/components/ShareManagementPanel.jsx`, mounted on
  the Dashboard below `YourReportsCard`. Hidden entirely when the
  parent has no active shares so it never clutters a fresh dashboard.
  Every row shows the "viewed N times · opened <relative>" pill, a
  copy-link, an open-in-new-tab button, and a confirm-gated revoke.
- Phase 3 Deep-Dive tone rewrite: Med Deep Dive `s2_confirmation`
  rewritten to neutral "How often does a pick-up confirmation reach
  both parents..." (was "Does the other parent get a confirmation..."
  which read accusatory). Edu-Deep and Psych-Deep v2 already use
  first-person "We..." aspirational stems — no changes needed.
- Coverage: `tests/test_iter127_...py` — 6 tests (jti persistence,
  token persistence, analytics aggregation, active/expired split,
  Med-Deep prompt neutrality). Iter123/124/126 fixtures updated
  to accept the `token=` kwarg. All 79 joint-artefact + Med-Deep
  tests pass.

### 2026-02-22 — Code review fix: 14-day share links honoured
- Code review surfaced a source-confirmed HIGH: parents choosing the
  "14 days" duration on the Joint Agreement / Joint Report share
  dialog silently got a 7-day token. `auth.SHARE_TOKEN_WINDOWS` was
  missing 14 while the route + UI advertised it, so
  `create_share_token` fell back to the 7-day default.
- Fix: added 14 to `SHARE_TOKEN_WINDOWS`. The emailed Joint
  Agreement preview link (hard-coded `expire_days=14`) also now lives
  the full 14 days.
- Coverage: `tests/test_iter128_...py` — 3 regression tests
  (round-trip every advertised window, disallowed value downgrades
  correctly, route choice sets stay a subset of the allowed windows).
  All 28 combined tests pass.

### 2026-02-22 — Silent-Reviewer Nudge sweep
- New backend module `silent_reviewer_nudge.py` — daily scheduler that
  emails the SENDING PARENT (never the reviewer) when a share they
  emailed via `/joint-agreement/{id}/email` or
  `/joint-professional-report/{id}/email` has gone unopened for
  N days. Defaults: threshold 3 days, sweep every 60 min, gated by
  `SILENT_REVIEWER_NUDGE_ENABLED=1`.
- Guards: idempotent (`nudged_at` stamped after first send so no
  candidate ever fires twice), skips revoked / expired tokens, skips
  manually-minted "Get shareable link" tokens (label prefix check),
  skips tokens whose `phi_access_log` already carries an
  `external_read_via_share_link` row.
- Nudge audit-logged as `silent_reviewer_nudge` on the parent's
  PHI-access history so their accounting-of-disclosures export stays
  complete.
- New `email_service.send_silent_reviewer_nudge(...)` template — HTML
  + plain, CTA back to `/dashboard` so the parent can re-send from
  the Share Management Panel with one tap.
- Coverage: `tests/test_iter129_...py` — 5 tests (ripe unopened is
  nudged and stamped, already-opened is stamped without send,
  revoked/expired/manual tokens skipped, dry_run reports without
  side effects, below-threshold share not nudged). Full 33-test
  joint-artefact suite green.

### 2026-02-22 — ChatGPT integration (Regenerate with GPT 5.6 Terra)
- New `ai_summary_gpt.generate_executive_summary_gpt(...)` — companion
  to `ai_summary.generate_executive_summary` that targets
  `openai/gpt-5.6-terra` via the Emergent Universal LLM Key. Same
  prompt, same neutral guardrails, same signals extraction. Never
  raises — the endpoint layer falls back to Claude on failure.
- `/api/edu-deep/report/regen-summary` gained an optional `model`
  param (`"claude"` default, `"gpt"` for the 5.6 Terra alternative).
  Invalid values downgrade to Claude. The regenerated report row
  now carries `ai_summary_model` so the UI can label who wrote it.
- `SpecialNeedsV2EducationalDeepDiveReport.jsx` — added a
  Claude / GPT 5.6 toggle beside the existing short/standard/long
  length toggle. Regenerate button sends both length and model.
  The timestamp caption now surfaces which model wrote the current
  summary.
- **Rollout note**: shipped on Edu Deep as the pilot surface. Same
  pattern will drop cleanly onto Med Deep / Psych Deep / Joint
  Report once the parent-side signal on Edu is clear.
- Coverage: `tests/test_iter130_...py` — 6 tests (module targets
  gpt-5.6-terra, fail-soft without key, fail-soft on exception,
  endpoint defaults to Claude, `model=gpt` dispatches to GPT,
  garbage values fall back to Claude). Full 39-test suite green.

### 2026-02-22 — Marketing Consent Toggle UI
- New reusable frontend component
  `/app/frontend/src/components/account/MarketingConsentToggle.jsx` —
  one-click HB 300 §181.152 marketing opt-in switch. Optimistic UI
  with roll-back on failure, toasts on both success + revert, and a
  "Currently opted IN / OUT" state chip so parents never guess.
- Mounted on `DataRetention.jsx` (parents' current account hub)
  above the retention schedule. Same component can drop into a
  future dedicated `/account` page with zero refactor.
- Wired to the existing backend endpoints (no new server code):
  - `GET  /api/me/hb300/status` for initial state
  - `POST /api/me/hb300/marketing` for the flip
- Every toggle change lands in `phi_access_log` as
  `marketing_opt_in` / `marketing_opt_out` per the existing HB 300
  route implementation, so the auditor can reconstruct the exact
  moment.
- Coverage: `tests/test_iter131_...py` — 3 contract tests
  (status returns flag, opt-in flips flag + writes PHI log,
  opt-out flips it back + writes log). All 28 recent iter-tests
  green.

### 2026-02-22 — Three-fer: /account page + Recent Shared on Joint Agreement + GPT toggle on Med/Psych
- **Dedicated `/account` page**: New `pages/Account.jsx` — settings hub
  hosting the marketing toggle, basic identity block, and deep-link
  tiles to Data & Retention / HB 300 Notice / Privacy Policy.
  Protected route (`<ProtectedRoute>`), reachable via a new
  `Settings` icon in `AppShell.jsx` next to Sign Out.
- **RecentlySharedWith on Joint Agreement**: Imported + mounted on
  `pages/JointAgreement.jsx` right below the action-buttons row.
  Same compact re-send strip already live on the Joint Report page.
- **GPT toggle extended to Med + Psych Deep Dive**:
  - Backend: `med_deep_routes.py` and `psych_deep_routes.py`
    `regen-summary` now take a `model` param and dispatch to
    Claude (default) or GPT 5.6 Terra. Invalid values downgrade
    to Claude. Row payload gains `ai_summary_model`.
  - Frontend: `SpecialNeedsV2MedicalDeepDiveReport.jsx` and
    `SpecialNeedsV2PsychologicalDeepDiveReport.jsx` mirror the
    Edu Deep model toggle + timestamp label pattern.
  - Joint Report doesn't have an LLM regen path (summary is
    composed from the Compare payload, not an LLM), so no toggle
    surface there.
- Coverage: `tests/test_iter132_...py` — 6 parametrised route tests
  (`med-deep` + `psych-deep`, defaults to Claude, `model=gpt`
  dispatches to GPT, invalid falls back). Full 48-test suite green.

### 2026-02-22 — Consent History modal
- New backend endpoint `GET /api/me/hb300/consent-history` — returns
  the caller's marketing opt-in / opt-out plus HB 300 acknowledgement
  rows from `phi_access_log`, newest first, capped at 200. No writes,
  filters strictly to the caller's own `user_id`, drops unrelated
  `phi_access_log` actions.
- New frontend component
  `/app/frontend/src/components/account/ConsentHistoryModal.jsx` —
  accessible dialog (Escape closes, click-outside closes, aria-modal
  set) with per-event icon + timestamp + IP + UA + notice version.
  Empty / loading / error states covered.
- `MarketingConsentToggle` now surfaces a compact "See history"
  button below the state chip that pops the modal open. Zero new
  data — just a mirror of the log the parent already generates.
- Coverage: `tests/test_iter133_...py` — 4 tests
  (filters to consent actions only, newest-first, row shape carries
  resource_id for ack rows, empty for a brand-new user). Full
  27-recent + 48-existing-iter test suite green.

### 2026-02-22 — New-Comment Toast (live reviewer-comment ping)
- New headless React component
  `/app/frontend/src/components/NewCommentToaster.jsx` — polls
  `/api/pathway-report/comments/mine` every 30s (plus on tab-focus)
  and fires a `sonner` toast for each newly-arrived reviewer
  comment. Aggregates when 3+ land at once so the corner stays
  tidy. Toast action deep-links to the
  `#pathway-reviewer-comments` anchor on the Dashboard for
  smooth-scroll (or navigates + hashes when the parent is
  elsewhere).
- Baseline: on first-ever mount, the newest `created_at` is
  written to `localStorage.pathwayCommentSeenAt` silently so a
  returning parent doesn't get a wall of toasts for comments
  that were already visible on the dashboard.
- Wired into `Dashboard.jsx` (only visible / active while the
  parent is on the primary in-app surface). Anchor `id` added
  to `PathwayReviewerCommentsCard` so scroll-into-view works.
- No new backend code — the endpoint has existed since the
  cosign portal work. Coverage `tests/test_iter134_...py` —
  3 contract tests locking the shape the toaster relies on
  (`total`+`comments` keys, per-row `comment_text` field name,
  newest-first ordering). All 30 recent iter-tests green.

## Prioritized Backlog

### 2026-03-04 — Meta / footer tagline refresh + App Store privacy disclosure
- **Tagline propagation**: `frontend/public/index.html` `<title>`, `meta description`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `<noscript>` H1 + intro paragraph, and the JSON-LD WebApplication `description` now all carry the "With Reflection. Build Alignment. Create Better Agreements." headline + the reconciled paragraph copy. `frontend/public/manifest.json` `description` updated to the same. Landing marketing footer subline replaced ("From conflict to cooperation.") with the new three-part tagline (`data-testid="footer-tagline"`).
- **App Store privacy disclosure**: new page `pages/AppStorePrivacy.jsx` at `/legal/app-store-privacy` — the single reconciled short-form statement referenced from both the Apple App Store Connect (App Privacy) and Google Play Console (Data Safety) submissions. Contents: five headline commitments (no tracking, no model training, encrypted in transit/at rest, delete anytime, adult-parent-only surface), 8-row reconciled data table (each row lists the Apple category + Google category, "Linked to user?", "Used for tracking?", and "Optional?"), a "data we deliberately do not collect" list, a data-sharing section, a parent-controls section, and a "store-console quick answers" copy-paste block for the operator submitting to each store. Linked from the main `/privacy` "See also" section as the first entry.
- **Sibling integration is still the P0 dropped task** — waiting on the spec paste to wire the 3 endpoints and shared-secret handling.
- Frontend compiled clean (only pre-existing intentional ESLint warnings). Iter135+136 backend tests still green (9/9). Verified via screenshot: `/legal/app-store-privacy` renders with title `Apple App Privacy & Google Play Data Safety — Reconciled Disclosure`; Landing footer now displays the new tagline.

### 2026-03-04 — Landing hero copy refresh (deploy prep)
- `Landing.jsx` hero (`Hero()`): replaced "Let's Start With You And Your
  Children." headline + supporting paragraph with the parent-facing
  tagline requested by the founder:
    - **WITH REFLECTION.**
    - **BUILD ALIGNMENT.**
    - **CREATE BETTER AGREEMENTS.**
  Followed by: *"SA CoParents helps parents independently identify their
  child's needs, concerns and parenting priorities, discover areas of
  shared understanding, identify differences without assigning blame,
  and explore options and resources for moving forward."*
- Styling: serif, uppercase, tracking-tight; purple `#3D1A78` accent on
  *Reflection / Alignment / Agreements*. Removed the italic
  reassurance line to keep the intro focused. New `data-testid`s:
  `hero-headline`, `hero-supporting-copy`.
- Frontend compiled clean (only pre-existing intentional ESLint
  warnings). Verified via screenshot on the preview URL.
- Dispatched to deployer alongside the Joint Reports Picker, 6-digit
  OTP flows, Foundation Statement Demo, Demo→Real upgrade CTAs, and
  Assessment History joint-report links.

### 2026-03-03 — Joint Reports Picker (two-circle chooser + topic grid)
- New `frontend/src/pages/JointReportsPicker.jsx` route at
  `/joint-reports` (protected). Two big primary circles
  (**Complete Joint Alignment Report** + **Family Violence /
  Communication Safety**) plus an 8-topic grid (Co-Parenting,
  Education, Medical, Psychological, Special Needs, Communication,
  Parenting Schedule, Activities). Topics with existing routes deep-
  link into the corresponding compare/intake; the last three render
  as non-interactive "Coming soon" chips.
- Crisis-line banner (911 + 1-800-799-7233 + text START to 88788)
  sits immediately below the Safety circle so parents in immediate
  danger see it without entering the assessment.
- Legend at the top names the **Private Reflection → Shared
  Alignment** boundary explicitly ("Your reflective answers stay
  private. Only the material you intentionally choose for comparison
  appears in the joint report."). Copy work only — no server-side
  privacy behavior changed (the boundary was already enforced).
- Dashboard: `ShareReportQuickAction` now shows *"See all report
  types →"* next to the pills so parents can jump straight to the
  picker.
- Verified in browser with `parent1@test.com`: title, legend, both
  primary circles, crisis banner, and all 8 topic tiles render. Deep-
  link URLs confirmed for Complete (routes with share_id) and 5
  wired topics; 3 "Coming soon" tiles are non-clickable.
- Regressions: 31 iter13x tests green (backend readiness PASS).

### 2026-03-02 — Code review remediation
- **[MEDIUM] `CodeInput.jsx` completion guard fix**: dropped the
  permanently-false `!joined.includes("")` clause. `onComplete` now
  fires reliably when all six OTP boxes are filled — auto-focus to
  password field in `ForgotPassword` and auto-verify in
  `VerificationBanner` work as designed. Added regression suite
  `CodeInput.test.jsx` (3 cases: digit-by-digit fill, SMS-autofill
  paste into box 0, non-digit stripping).
- **[LOW] URL builder helper**: extracted
  `frontend/src/lib/jointArtefactUrls.js` (`jointReportUrl`,
  `jointAgreementUrl`). Consolidated three previously-duplicated
  hand-built URL strings in `ShareReportQuickAction`,
  `JointAlignmentPromoCard`, `AssessmentHistoryCard`.
- **[LOW] Rate limit hardening for shared NAT**: `/verify-email/send-
  code` and `/password-reset/request-code` now require BOTH per-IP AND
  per-email counts to exceed `CODE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` before
  returning 429. Two co-parents on the same home Wi-Fi can each
  request their own code without locking each other out; a single IP
  hammering many accounts still hits the cap.
- Backend regressions: all 87 iter tests green.
- Frontend regressions: 3/3 new `CodeInput` tests green.

### 2026-03-01 — Third access point: Assessment History card on Dashboard
- New `frontend/src/components/AssessmentHistoryCard.jsx` — compact
  table of every completed prep module. Each row exposes a right-side
  action:
    - If Compare share is ready → *"View Joint Alignment Report →"*
      routing to `/joint-professional-report?share=<id>&mint=1` (one-tap
      to the mint dialog).
    - Otherwise → subtle *"Review"* link to the module route so the
      row still deep-links back into the flow.
  Only renders when at least one module is complete.
- Mounted below the SNC highlights block in `Dashboard.jsx`. Reads
  from the existing `prep.completed` state and `sncHighlights` prop —
  zero new network calls.
- Header shows a *"Joint Report ready"* chip and a soft waiting hint
  when no share exists yet ("Invite your co-parent to see a Joint
  Alignment Report link appear next to each row.").
- Verified in browser with `parent1@test.com`: 5 completed rows, 5
  View Joint Alignment Report links, ready chip visible. All 87 iter
  tests green.

### 2026-02-28 — Foundation Demo on Landing + Sign In on demo banner
- `Landing.jsx` "How it works" section:
  - Step 4 (Foundation Statement) card now shows a *"See what one looks
    like →"* link routing to `/foundation/demo`.
  - New outlined pill *"See a sample Foundation Statement →"* below the
    six-step grid so visitors can peek at a real artefact before
    signing up.
- `DemoModeBanner.jsx`: added an outlined *"Sign in to my account"*
  pill next to the existing solid *"Keep it forever →"* CTA. Gives
  demo users two clear paths — sign into an existing account or claim
  the current demo as a new one. Complements the header pill added
  earlier for redundancy.

### 2026-02-27 — Header Sign In pill for demo users
- `frontend/src/components/AppShell.jsx`: purple "Sign in" pill in the
  top nav rendered only when `user?.is_guest === true`, routing to
  `/login`. Mirrored into the mobile menu. Real (non-guest) accounts
  see no change. Solves the demo-user complaint that there was no way
  to sign into an existing account from within the dashboard without
  hitting Landing.

### 2026-02-26 — Report navigation trap fixes + Foundation Statement demo view
- **Fix "stuck in report" trap**:
  - `JointProfessionalReport.jsx` + `JointAgreement.jsx`: strip `?mint=1`
    from the URL immediately after the auto-open fires, so a refresh /
    back-forward / PWA relaunch doesn't retrigger the mint dialog.
  - New `frontend/src/components/SignedInEscapeHatch.jsx`: subtle "Back
    to your dashboard" affordance that renders only when a real user is
    signed in. Mounted on `JointReportShared.jsx` and
    `JointAgreementShared.jsx` so signed-in parents landing on their
    own public shared link have an in-app way home. Reviewers see
    nothing — their view stays clean.
- **New route** `/foundation/demo`:
  - Public preview of a completed Foundation Statement using composite
    fictional content mirroring the four Reflection prompts (child's
    eyes / own part / best-case outcome / co-parent's eyes). Every
    panel watermarked *EXAMPLE* so it can never be confused with real
    data. Two CTAs (start your own / explore dashboard). Shareable
    without auth — plants nicely in marketing emails or Landing.
  - New entry points: `/my-plan` empty state adds *"See what one looks
    like →"* under *"Write it →"*; `Reflection.jsx` intro adds *"See
    what a finished Foundation Statement looks like →"*.
- All 87 iter tests still green. UI verified in browser.

### 2026-02-25 — "Joint Alignment Report" terminology + assessment-completion promo card
- New `frontend/src/components/JointAlignmentPromoCard.jsx` — the
  "unmistakable next action" card. Two states via the existing
  `/snc2/compare/dashboard/highlights` + `/invites/coparent` endpoints:
  - Waiting: big **Create a Joint Alignment Report** headline, inline
    "Co-Parent's email" field + **Invite Co-Parent** button. Copy
    reassures: *"You never share passwords."*
  - Ready: **Your Joint Alignment Report is ready** with two solid
    CTAs — *View Joint Alignment Report* / *View Joint Alignment
    Agreement* — both routed with `?mint=1` so the parent lands in the
    share-link mint dialog in one tap.
- Mounted at the top of `/next-steps/:assessment` (`NextSteps.jsx`) and
  above the video block on `/summary` (`Summary.jsx`).
- Parent-facing terminology swept from "Joint Professional Report" and
  "Joint Agreement Draft" → **Joint Alignment Report** / **Joint
  Alignment Agreement** across `Dashboard.jsx`, `PathwayReport.jsx`,
  `SpecialNeedsV2CompareView.jsx`, `JointProfessionalReport.jsx`,
  `JointAgreement.jsx`, `ShareReportQuickAction.jsx`, `Landing.jsx`.
- Kept on-artefact professional-facing labels ("Joint Co-Parenting
  Summary for Professional Review", "Joint Co-Parenting Agreement
  Draft") unchanged on the shared-view pages and PDF outputs so
  mediators/attorneys still recognise the artefact they receive.
- Added parent-facing sublines directly under the artefact H1s on both
  Joint pages: *"This is your Joint Alignment Report — send it to your
  mediator or attorney. Your co-parent sees the same version."*
- New `tests/test_iter136_promo_card_endpoints_contract.py` — 3 tests
  locking the read-shape of the two endpoints the promo card depends
  on. All 87 iter tests green. UI verified in browser: both waiting
  and ready states render as designed.

### 2026-02-24 — In-app 6-digit code flows for email verify & password reset
- New auth endpoints on `/api/auth/`:
  - `POST /verify-email/send-code` — mints a bcrypt-hashed 6-digit code
    (15-min TTL, 5 attempts, 5/hr per-IP rate limit) and emails it via
    Resend. Always 200 for privacy.
  - `POST /verify-email/confirm-code` — validates `{email, code}`,
    flips `email_verified: true`.
  - `POST /password-reset/request-code` — same shape, mode `reset_code`.
  - `POST /password-reset/confirm-code` — validates `{email, code,
    password}`, rotates the password, marks the email verified,
    burns any other outstanding auth tokens for the user, signs them in.
- `email_service.py`: new `send_verification_code` and
  `send_password_reset_code` templates with a big letter-spaced code
  block and no CTA button (parents type the code back into the app).
- New reusable `frontend/src/components/CodeInput.jsx` — 6-box numeric
  entry with auto-advance, backspace clear-previous, arrow-key nav,
  paste distribution, and `one-time-code` autocomplete hint.
- `ForgotPassword.jsx` rewritten as a two-step flow: enter email →
  receive code → type code + new password → auto sign-in. Toast
  messaging preserves account-existence privacy.
- `VerificationBanner.jsx` gains an "Enter code instead" button — the
  banner sends the code inline and swaps in the 6-box input without
  navigating away.
- `Register.jsx`: added a subtle "Already have an account? Reset
  password" link below the password field so returning users don't
  have to bounce back to Login first.
- New `tests/test_iter135_code_based_verification_and_reset.py` — 6
  pytest cases covering happy path, wrong-code attempts,
  invalidate-older-codes, already-verified short-circuit, unknown-email
  privacy, and 5-attempt lockout. All 84 iter tests pass.

### 2026-02-23 — OG image swap + Dashboard "Share a report" quick action
- `frontend/public/index.html`: swapped `og:image` / `twitter:image` to the
  new `screenshots/joint-composite-og.png` (1200×630 letterboxed) with the
  full-res `joint-composite.png` (2560×987) as a secondary tag. Titles /
  descriptions updated to "Two separated parents — one shared story."
  So every share of `sacoparentsapp.online` on Slack, iMessage, WhatsApp,
  or Twitter renders the composite instead of the generic logo.
- `frontend/public/screenshots/joint-composite-og.png`: generated
  1200×630 letterboxed version of the composite for social scrapers.
- New `frontend/src/components/ShareReportQuickAction.jsx`: compact pill
  in the Dashboard Step 1 hero. Routes to
  `/joint-professional-report?share=<id>&mint=1` when the Compare share
  is ready; otherwise a soft-locked "unlocks after your Compare is ready"
  state so the entry point is always visible.
- `frontend/src/pages/JointProfessionalReport.jsx`: auto-fires the mint
  dialog when `?mint=1` is present (once the report finishes loading).
- Verified with screenshot tool — pill renders in ready state for
  `parent1@test.com` (active Compare share) and routes cleanly.

### P1 — Upcoming
- Policy-Refresh Email Blast (returning parents notice of new privacy)
- Marketing-toggle UI on account page (backend endpoint exists)
- Multi-State OCR payload (`total_individuals_affected`,
  `ocr_threshold_crossed` for federal ≥500 breach line)
- Live Operator Alert on breach draft filing
- Nudge Operator Preview endpoint (admin-only next-Monday preview)
- New-Comment toast on dashboard when reviewer comments land
- HTML Co-Parenting Agreement form (user request — clarifying qs pending)

### P2 — Future
- Multi-reviewer chain for co-sign portal (stack second signature)
- MongoDB field-level encryption at rest on safety/snc2/agreements
- Split `Dashboard.jsx` (1,190 lines), `SafetyAssessment.jsx` (~1,086),
  `Privacy.jsx` (618), `AppRoutes` (402)
- Refactor `ai_service.generate_nd_report` and
  `admin_nd_case_pdf.build_admin_case_history_pdf` (complexity 21)
- Hoist static Safety.jsx inline arrays to module constants

### P3 — Backlog
- Audio Intro for Professionals (Shimmer TTS on 3-min transcript)
- "Anchored Badge" pill on regenerated clauses
- Centralised /samples landing page for all 18 sample PDFs

## Known Non-Regressions (do NOT auto-fix)
- SAST hook-deps: mass-adding causes infinite fetch loops on this repo
- Circular imports: function-scoped intentionally to dodge FastAPI
  startup deadlocks
- MD5 in `intervention_compliance_routes.py`: `usedforsecurity=False`
  for stable user dedupe hashes
- localStorage instances (28): non-sensitive UX state (banner
  dismissals, orientation flags)
